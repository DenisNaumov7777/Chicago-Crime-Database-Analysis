## 🗃️ Database Creation

Run the script to generate `FinalDB.db`:

```bash
python scripts/create_database.py


🧠 Key SQL Queries
🥇 Area with Highest Hardship Index
SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME
FROM CENSUS_DATA
WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX = (SELECT MAX(HARDSHIP_INDEX) FROM CENSUS_DATA);

🚨 Community Area with Most Crimes
SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME
FROM CENSUS_DATA
WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = (
    SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
    FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
    WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1
);

📈 Example Notebook
